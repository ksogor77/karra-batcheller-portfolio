I focused on created a simple and beautiful website to showcase my information for prospective employers.  
I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
I began by creating the format for my page and filling in the necessary information and then adjusting 
the formatting to accomodate the information.  I then chose a color palette and background image and finally the fonts.

Two unsolved problems I have is centering my containers and changing the color of my navbar text.  I researched different ways 
to solve these issues, but am still searching for a working solution.

I'm very proud of the overall appearance of my site and am excited to continue working on it and streamlining the appearance 
and functionality.
